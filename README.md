Welcome to Scriptor, the mod which gives words power.
This Vanilla-style mod adds various kinds of magic spell to the world
with the aim of making discovery and spellcrafting simple, interesting,
and reasonable when compared to Vanilla gear and capabilities.

In this mod, spells are constructed much like sentences, with a catch:

**The words and sentence structure used are random in every world!**

For the average player, plenty of spells can be obtained in each world,
but for anyone dedicated enough, you can reverse engineer these spells
and learn how to draft even more powerful spells yourself.

## Items

### Spellbook

These books will cast any valid spell contained within, and have a shorter
cooldown (70% of the duration by default) than spoken spells. In addition,
tools such as Spellbooks won't generally negatively affect their user.

They can be crafted by placing a **[Spellbook Binder](#spellbook-binder)** on
a Written Book in a Smithing Table.

### Ancient Tomes

Ancient Tomes can be found in libraries in the world, as well as given out
by Librarians as a reward for saving villages.

When dusted off (right clicked), these reveal Books or Spellbooks containing
Spells created in times long past.

### Spellbook Binder

Spellbook Binders can be crafted and placed onto any Written Book at a 
Smithing Table to create a **[Spellbook](#spellbook)**.

### Mundane Leather Binder

Leather Binders can be crafted and placed onto any **[Spellbook](#spellbook)**
to turn it into a Written Book. 
This can be used to copy books or reveal their contents.

## Casting

In addition to casting Spells from a **[Spellbook](#spellbook)**, you 
may also speak a Spell aloud in order to either test it or construct
new Spells on the fly.

Casting Spells yourself does come with some advantages and drawbacks
which Spellbooks don't carry. When casting a Spell, your throat may be
burned by magical residue. For most low-level spells, this won't do much
but prevent you from casting more spells verbally. If constructing spells,
be careful, however, as cast spells may harm or change you in ways a 
Spellbook wouldn't.

If you're ever in doubt, remember the 3 H's.

### Hoarse

A hoarse throat is not uncommon when casting spells.
When your throat isn't in peak condition, it may be hard to cast
any additional spells.
Thankfully, this is easily remedied by drinking a tall glass of 
milk or waiting a moment.

### Hungry

Higher-level spells may drain your life slightly, only enough to make 
you peckish. 
This *is* an indicator that you may be approaching your limits, however,
so you should be careful if you notice this.

### Hurt

When approaching the heights of humanly achievable sorcery, spells may 
begin harming you directly.
This is a sign to watch your back, and potentially set up some magical
safeguards.

## Making your own Spells

Unfortunately, I am limited on how much advice I can give when it comes 
to writing your own spells. 
The structure of sentences and the words you need to use to create spells 
will differ based on the world (server/save) you are in.

I can advise you search out [Ancient Tomes](#ancient-tomes), and compare
the effects of the spells within in order to learn more about the words
that make up Spells in your world. 
Pay attention to words they may have in common, as well as the placement
of specific types of words within them.
