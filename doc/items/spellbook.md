*A Spellbook*

These books will cast any valid spell contained within, and have a shorter
cooldown (70% of the duration by default) than spoken spells. In addition,
tools such as Spellbooks won't generally negatively affect their user.

They can be crafted by placing a **[Spellbook Binder](spellbook-binder.md)** on
a Written Book in a Smithing Table.
