# Casting

## Spellbook

Currently the only tool you can use to cast spells is the 
**[Spellbook](../items/spellbook.md)**. 
Excepting one-off spells, testing spells, or targeting people by their 
true names, this is generally how most people will use magic.

Spells cast from a spellbook are generally around 70% the cost of the
spell when cast verbally, and will have less adverse effects on the user.
There is a limit to the maximum power of a spell cast through a spellbook,
after which spells will fizzle.

## Verbal Casting

In addition to casting Spells from a **[Spellbook](../items/spellbook.md)**, you
may also speak a Spell aloud in order to either test it or construct
new Spells on the fly.

Casting Spells yourself does come with some advantages and drawbacks
which Spellbooks don't carry. When casting a Spell, your throat may be
burned by magical residue. For most low-level spells, this won't do much
but prevent you from casting more spells verbally. If constructing spells,
be careful, however, as cast spells may harm or change you in ways a
Spellbook wouldn't.

If you're ever in doubt, remember the 3 H's.

### Hoarse

A hoarse throat is not uncommon when casting spells.
When your throat isn't in peak condition, it may be hard to cast
any additional spells.
Thankfully, this is easily remedied by drinking a tall glass of
milk or waiting a moment.

### Hungry

Higher-level spells may drain your life slightly, only enough to make
you peckish.
This *is* an indicator that you may be approaching your limits, however,
so you should be careful if you notice this.

### Hurt

When approaching the heights of humanly achievable sorcery, spells may
begin harming you directly.
This is a sign to watch your back, and potentially set up some magical
safeguards.
